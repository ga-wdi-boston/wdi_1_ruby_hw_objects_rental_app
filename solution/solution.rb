# Specification:

### Create a class for a Building that will have these attributes (address,style, number of floors and 
### 	apartments)
### Create a class for an Apartment that will have these attributes (number, rent, square feet, number of 
### 	bedrooms and renters)
### Create a class for a Person that will have these attributes (name, age, gender and apartment)
### Create one or more buildings, Building instances, and add it's attributes
### In each of these buildings add apartments and each apartment's attributes.
### In each of these apartments add people/renters.
# For each building calculate the average age of people living in this building and print this value out. 
# Use a method for this calculation
### For each apartment calculate the density people per square foot of the people living there. 
### And print this value out. Use a method for this calculation
# For each apartment in a building calculate how much eachp person/renter should pay for rent if 
# they all split the rent equally. And print this value out. Use a method for this calculation
